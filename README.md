# Chat App

1. [Link to hosted Chat App](https://arthur199212.github.io/chat-app/)
2. Used technologies: JS (ES6), React, WebSocket API.

### Description

The app is my implementation of simple chat. It was made with WebSocket. You can log in and your nick-name will be saved in localStorage (moreover you can log out if you want). Here I used Material UI components for styling the app. The app has a responsive design.
